Hello fellow humans, and not fellow digital consciousnesses please read all about the about me that I can fit in a single screen opf text

- I am @anakirob (pronounced Anarchy Rob) My username on most platforms is anakirob, but sometimes Mr. Roboto. I am not the kind of person
who would ever be anonymous. If you were my mates you would just call me Rob - The classic Amiga architecture is my favourite computing pl
atform, if you were to look at what can be found here then you might see that there's mostly if not exclusively Amiga projects found here,
maybe some other retro platforms, maybe some modern stuff. BBC Micro and other Acorn machines are cool too, my first experience of home co
mputing on a distant cousins Commodore 64. I like playing games but like operating systems more. - Iâ€™m not much of a coder but I do manage
some projects and maybe even type a few lines every now and then. I have design and layout education, Trade is  musician making music with
more balls than the water trap at the bottom of the ninth. - I am not interested in signing any employment contracts, however I am availab
le for freelance work as if and when the need and or inclination arisess. - I have been diagnosed as on the Autistic spectrum but then who
isn't? Some folks are the kind of Autistic where they are non verbal, I am like the other kind, the positively effusive kind. As evidenced
by this wall of text - Expert English linguist, musician by trade, qualified in graphic design, those who know me and will surely either l
ove or hate me, very little middle ground to be found - Oh, and I am an extracellestial being. I have breached this sphere of existence fr
om another sphere on another plane, it was something of an industrial accident, sorry about that. I do not believe this of course but if u
do then I think you might have bigger problems than a human who believes that before the were here being a man they were there being a Fae
and they/I who accidentally fell into Jah's infinity pearl on accident. What is fiction to us is real to the fiction, also what is real to
us is conversely fiction to the fictitious - Not only am I from another dimension, but I am also living in the future for all except those
who are in Aotearoa or some other small rocky outcroppings. - Bitcoin is the only current Crypto currency with any intrinsic value, I will
advise against any other trading on the blockchain. - I was raised first in the Anglican and then Bethesda Evangelical flavours of the Chr
istian faith and I do wonder why for a religion that purports to be following Yeshua ben Yousef why do they all seem to be following Paul?
When one passes on from being alive it will be much like it was before one were born I feel is consistent with the reality that I have wit
nessed. - My religion is Druid, My supreme diety is potato. I am polytheistic with myself being one of the chief among my pantheon. Bother
by what you just read, well: We are all carriers of what we might call mental illness, there is not a single person on this earth that wou
ld not check all the boxes for at least one condition in the DSM, mental illness being the perception of things that are not consistent to
the nature of reality. the only thing that makes it "illness" is ones ability to cope without causing some kind of disruption. If one woul
d claim to be totally sane then that one would most surely be indubidoubly the most dangerous kind of crazy. - The internet of today is no
way the internet that was envisioned by the original architects. If you can read this then you are too close, why not stand up and stretch
your legs, make yourself a nice beverage, take some deep breaths and then get back to me, ok :) - Socialism is not opposed to Capitalism,
it is simply another form of it where the capitalists are the people who produce and oligarchs are not a thing that exists - Communism how
ever IS opposed the concept of capital and to fairness as it is inherently authoroitarian. Free the enslaved, end incarceration now please

- tl;dr - Male, Millenial, Irish-Australian, Linguist, Musician and Designer, ask me for any help with anything I will tackle it like none
